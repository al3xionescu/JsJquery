With jQuery you select HTML elements and perform some actions on them.
Classic syntax is: $(selector).action()
Some examples are: 1. $(this).hide() - hides the current element
                   2. $("p").hide() - hides all <p> elements
                   3. $(".test").hide() - hides all elements with class "test"
                   4. $("#test").hide() - hides all elements with id "test"

$(document).ready(function(){

  // jQuery methods
  
});

When jQuery methods are inside a document ready event, it is to prevent any jQuery code from running before the document is finished loading (is ready).
It is good practice to wait for the document to be fully loaded and ready before working with it.
